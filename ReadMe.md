# Example Source Code for Winthrop's CSCI460, Machine Learning Course

This public repo contains examples we're using in our Machine Learning class.  To get them to work, you'll need to add the examples directory to your *PYTHONPATH*:

```
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/CSCI460X-Examples:${PYTHONPATH}
```

If you are running our Docker container, you can create a file in your *persistent-homedir* called *.bashrc* with the following line in it:

```
export PYTHONPATH=/home/student/CSCI460X-Examples:${PYTHONPATH}
```
